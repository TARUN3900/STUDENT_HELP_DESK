There are few dependencies for whih I have used Docker application to satisfy the dependencies

If the dependencies are satisdfied..
To Run the Software:
1. open Command Prompt and go to the file directory.
2. go to code directory then to student's help desk directory
3. use the command: python app.py
4. a local http link will appear.
5. copy paste the link in a browser
And the program will run properly

If the Code doesn't run make sure all the dependencies are met.
